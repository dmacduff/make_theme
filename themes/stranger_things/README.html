<p>
You are the system administrator for the Hawkins Inc.  
You have been tasked with examining and securing a workstation that may 
have been compromised by a disgruntled employee.
</p>

<p>The person who was assigned this workstation (hawkins) had access 
to sensitive files, and is suspected of copying those files from the 
company server and sharing them with unauthorized people. This may 
include documents, media files or photographs. This person may have 
also installed spyware or made other changes to compromise the security of the system.
</p>

<p>Authorized administrators:
<pre>
hopper: hopper123
elle: elle123
carlosr: elle123

</pre>
</p>

<p>Authorized users: 
<pre>
will: will1234
nancy: nancy1235
joemama: nancy1235

</pre>

<p>This workstation is used for web browsing, e-mail and word 
processing only.  No multimedia files or other applications should 
be installed.
</p>

<p>Company password policy requires that passwords should be complex 
and of a sufficient length to prevent brute-force attacks.  Passwords 
on all accounts should be changed on a regular basis, and users should 
not be able to reuse their recent passwords.  Policies should be 
implemented to prevent attackers from repeatedly guessing passwords.  
</p>

<p>The only people who should be able to remotely access the computer 
are the administrators, and ssh is the only remote access software 
permitted. 
</p>

<p>Security patches for the operating system and all critical i
software should be kept up to date.
</p>

<p>
Auditing should be enable to allow the security team to determine who 
tries to log into the system. 
</p>


<p>
Critical services: sshd, postfix
